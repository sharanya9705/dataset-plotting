This project focuses on analyzing soil erosion data in coastal Karnataka using data science techniques. The dataset contains various parameters that influence soil erosion, and through the application of statistical methods, the project aims to identify key factors contributing to soil degradation. The analysis includes preprocessing the data, feature engineering, and modeling to gain insights into erosion patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help mitigate soil erosion through informed decision-making. This repository contains the necessary code for data processing, analysis, and visualization using Python and machine learning libraries.
